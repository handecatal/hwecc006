    <h2>6 Keys to Success with Roses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Site. Roses crave sun, at least six hours a day is ideal.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Soil. Plant roses in rich, well-draining soil. When planting, mix organic matter, such as compost or ground bark, into excavated soil you'll use to backfill the planting hole.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Mulch. Add a 2-3-inch layer of coarse, organic mulch around roses. Coarse mulch helps reduce foliage diseases on roses because it reduces the amount of water splashing onto leaves (splashing water drops can spread fungal diseases).</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Water. Irrigate roses deeply but infrequently, applying water directly to soil using soaker hoses or drip irrigation. Water needs vary based on weather and soil, so check soil with your finger. Water often enough to create consistently
        moist soil – not overly wet, not bone-dry. To prevent diseases, keep foliage dry, especially if you must water late in the day.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspect. Check roses frequently for insects or disease outbreaks. Catching problems early makes them easier to treat.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Prune. Roses need regular pruning.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>6 Tips for Success with Peonies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;They don’t like to be disturbed. So plant them in a good place and leave them. </li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s face it, these flowers are extremely ephemeral, like most beauty. So plant multiple varieties that bloom early, mid and late in the season.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy nice tubers with 4 to 5 eyes and take your time planting them.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose varieties suited to your climate.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they have bloomed I remove the seed heads.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first couple of years refrain from cutting the blooms from the plants with extra long stems.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Care for Succulents (And Not Kill Them)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Make Sure Your Succulents Get Enough Light.<br>
        Succulents love light and need about six hours of sun per day, depending on the type of succulent. Newly planted succulents can scorch in direct sunlight, so you may need to gradually introduce them to full sun exposure or provide shade with
        a sheer curtain.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotate Succulents Frequently. <br>
        Succulents love direct sun, but if yours is sitting in the same exact spot day after day, it's likely that only one side is getting enough light. Langton and Ray suggest rotating the plant often. Succulents will lean towards the sun, so
        rotating them will help them stand up straight.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Water According to the Season. <br>
        Just like us, succulents need more energy when they're in a period of growth. During the spring and summer, the plants are thriving and drinking up much more water than when they're resting in the fall and winter. Langton and Ray recommend
        testing the soil with a finger—when the top 1.25 inches are dry, grab your watering can. Overwatering can kill your succulent, so make sure you let the soil dry between waterings.</li>
      <li><img id="bullet-point" src="images/peony.png" alt="peony-image">&nbsp;&nbsp;Water the Soil Directly. <br>
        When you water your succulents, soak the soil until water runs out of the drainage holes. (If your container doesn’t have drainage holes, use less water.) Don’t use a spray bottle to water your succulents—misting can cause brittle roots and
        moldy leaves . You can also place pots in a pan of water and allow the water to absorb through the drainage hole. Once the top of the soil is moist, remove from the pan.</li>
